## In considering discreteness rather than continuity as fundamental it seems that [Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity An Elementary Introduction to Quantum Gravity and Spinfoam Theory by Rovelli and Vidotto in 2014]({{< relref "Covariant_Loop_Quantum_Gravity_An_Elementary_Introduction_to_Quantum_Gravity_and_Spinfoam_Theory_by_Rovelli_and_Vidotto_in_2014" >}}) and [Wolfram physics project]({{< relref "Wolfram_physics_project" >}}) both have something useful to say. {#in-considering-discreteness-rather-than-continuity-as-fundamental-it-seems-that-covariant-loop-quantum-gravity-an-elementary-introduction-to-quantum-gravity-and-spinfoam-theory-by-rovelli-and-vidotto-in-2014--covariant-loop-quantum-gravity-an-elementary-introduction-to-quantum-gravity-and-spinfoam-theory-by-rovelli-and-vidotto-in-2014-dot-md--and-wolfram-physics-project--wolfram-physics-project-dot-md--both-have-something-useful-to-say-dot}


## \_\_Calculating Space (German: Rechnender Raum) is [[file:Konrad\_Zuse.org][Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculating%5FSpace)'s 1969 book on automata theory. He proposed that just as chemistry was reduced to physics, so could physics be reduced to theoretical computer science (or informatics, in german informatik)\_\_ — via [Calculating Space \* Wikipedia]] {#calculating-space--german-rechnender-raum--is-file-konrad-zuse-dot-org-konrad-zuse-s-1969-book-on-automata-theory-dot-he-proposed-that-just-as-chemistry-was-reduced-to-physics-so-could-physics-be-reduced-to-theoretical-computer-science--or-informatics-in-german-informatik--via-calculating-space-wikipedia}


## \_\_Zuse was the first to propose that physics is just computation, suggesting that the history of our universe is being computed on, say, a cellular automaton. His "Rechnender Raum" (Computing Cosmos / Calculating Space <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-663-02723-2> ) started the field of Digital Physics in 1967.\_\_ — via [Zuse's Thesis \* Zuse hypothesis \* Algorithmic Theory of Everything \* Digital Physics, Rechnender Raum (Computing Space, Computing Cosmos) \* Computable Universe \* The Universe is a Computer \* Theory of Everything](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/digitalphysics.html) {#zuse-was-the-first-to-propose-that-physics-is-just-computation-suggesting-that-the-history-of-our-universe-is-being-computed-on-say-a-cellular-automaton-dot-his-rechnender-raum--computing-cosmos-calculating-space-https-doi-dot-org-10-dot-1007-978-3-663-02723-2--started-the-field-of-digital-physics-in-1967-dot-via-zuse-s-thesis-zuse-hypothesis-algorithmic-theory-of-everything-digital-physics-rechnender-raum--computing-space-computing-cosmos--computable-universe-the-universe-is-a-computer-theory-of-everything}

-   Then the simplest explanation of our universe is the simplest program that computes it. In 1997 Schmidhuber pointed out [1] that the simplest such program actually computes all possible universes with all types of physical constants and laws, not just ours. His essay also talks about universes simulated within parent universes in nested fashion, and about universal complexity-based measures on possible universes.
