### 1.1 The need for prequantum geometry {#1-dot-1-the-need-for-prequantum-geometry}

<!--list-separator-->

-  The Faraday tensor \\[F\\] encodes the classical Lorentz force that the electromagnetic field on a spacetime \\[X\\] exerts on an electron (propagating in that field).

-  Within a particular region \\[U\\] the quantum electron couples to the vector potential which is a differential 1-form \\[A\_U\\], such that \\[dA\_U = F|\_U\\]. This is to say that the differential of the vector potential within the region \\[U\\] is equivalent to the restriction of the global Faraday tensor \\[F\\] to the given region.

-  To define the quantized electron globally requires lifting of the locally defined vector potentials to an \\[\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\\]-principal connection on a \\[\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}\\]-[principal bundle]({{< relref "principal_bundle" >}}) over spacetime \\[X\\]. The first Chern class of the principle bundle is quantized as the magnetic charge whose induced force the electron feels. This is a prerequisite to the quantization of the electron dynamics and is an example of pre-quantization.

-  The coupling of quarks to the week and strong nuclear forces is described locally by a \\[\mathfrak{su}(n)\\] Lie algebra valued 1-form \\[A\_U\\] from which the strength of the nuclear force field is encoded by the 2-form \\[F|\_U = dA\_U + 1/2 [ A\_U  \wedge A\_U ]\\]. For the consistent quantization of quarks as required for the global definition of Wilson loop observables, this local data must be lifted to an \\[SU(n)\\]-principal connection on a \\[SU(n)\\]-[principal bundle]({{< relref "principal_bundle" >}}) over spacetime \\[X\\]. The second Chern class of this bundle is quantized and is physically interpreted as the number of instantons. Instantons are expressed in physics via Chern-Simons 3-forms which are mathematically the pre-quantization of the 4-form \\[ \mathrm{tr}(F \wedge F)\\] to a 2-gerbe with 2-connection.
