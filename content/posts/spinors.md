## Definition of spinors and their relation to [Clifford algebras]({{< relref "Clifford_algebras" >}}) {#definition-of-spinors-and-their-relation-to-clifford-algebras--clifford-algebras-dot-md}


### --<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#Terminology%5Fin%5Fphysics> {#https-en-dot-wikipedia-dot-org-wiki-spinor-terminology-in-physics}

-   The constructions given above, in terms of [Clifford algebra]({{< relref "Clifford_algebras" >}}) or [representation theory]({{< relref "representation_theory" >}}), can be thought of as defining [spinors]({{< relref "spinors" >}}) as geometric objects in zero-dimensional space-time. To obtain the spinors of physics, such as the Dirac spinor, one extends the construction to obtain a spin structure on 4-dimensional space-time (Minkowski space).
-   Effectively, one starts with the tangent manifold of space-time, each point of which is a 4-dimensional vector space with \\(SO(3,1)\\) symmetry, and then builds the spin group at each point. The neighborhoods of points are endowed with concepts of smoothness and differentiability: the standard construction is one of a fibre bundle, the fibers of which are affine spaces transforming under the [spin group]({{< relref "spin_group" >}}). This is the so-called [spinor bundle]({{< relref "spinor_bundle" >}}).

-  ****After constructing the [fiber bundle]({{< relref "fiber_bundle" >}}), one may then consider**** [dynamical systems]({{< relref "dynamical_systems" >}}), such as the [\_\_Dirac equation\_\_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac%5Fequation>), or the [\_\_Weyl equation\_\_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl%5Fequation>) \*\*on the [fiber bundle]({{< relref "fiber_bundle" >}}).\*\* These equations (Dirac or Weyl) have solutions that are [plane waves](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane%5Fwave>), ****having symmetries characteristic of the fibers****, i.e. having the symmetries of [spinors]({{< relref "spinors" >}}), as obtained from the (zero-dimensional) [Clifford algebras]({{< relref "Clifford_algebras" >}}) / spin [representation theory]({{< relref "representation_theory" >}}) described above. Such plane-wave solutions (or other solutions) of the differential equations can then properly be called [\_\_fermions\_\_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion>); fermions have the algebraic qualities of [spinors]({{< relref "spinors" >}}). ****By general convention, the terms "fermion" and "spinor" are often used interchangeably in physics, as synonyms of one-another.**** It appears that all [\_\_fundamental particles\_\_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental%5Fparticle>) in nature that are spin-1/2 are described by the Dirac equation, with the possible exception of the [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino).
