    -  If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are really three fundamental observations

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  1. Space-time is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, \\[M\\], endowed with a metric tensor and governed by geometrical laws

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  2. Over \\[M\\] is a principal \\[G\\]-bundle, \\[P\_G\\], with a non-Abelian structure group \\[G\\]

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  3. Fermions are sections of \\[\hat{S}\_+ \otimes V\_R \oplus \hat{S}\_\* \otimes V\_{\tilde{R}}\\]. \\[R\\] and \\[\tilde{R}\\] are not isomorphic, but should be complex linear representations of \\[G\\]

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  4. ? Higgs

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.

-  For even \\[n\\], the irreducible representation \\[S\\] of the Clifford algebra has dimension \\[2^{n/2}\\] and for odd \\[n\\] its dimension is \\[2^{(n-1)/2}\\]

<!--list-separator-->

-  The Clifford module \\[S\\] automatically furnishes a representation of the Lorentz group \\[SO(1,n-1)\\] named the spinor representation whose Lorentz generators are

    -  \\[\Sigma^{ij} = -\Sigma^{ji}=\frac{1}{4}[\Gamma^i, \Gamma^j]\\]

<!--list-separator-->

-  For even \\[n\\], \\[S\\] decomposes into \\[S = S\_+ \oplus S\_-\\] which are the eigenspaces of the involution

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  \\[\bar{\Gamma} = i^{(n+2)/4} \Gamma^1 \Gamma^2 \ldots \Gamma^n\\]

<!--list-separator-->

-  If the second Stiefel-Whitney class of \\[M\\] vanishes, we can define the spin bundle of \\[M\\] as \\[\hat{S}\\], which is the vector bundle whose bundle at fiber \\[p \in M\\] is the Clifford module associated to the Dirac matrices given above.

<!--list-separator-->

-  A physical field \\[\psi\\] is a section of \\[\hat{S}\\] called a spin one-half fermi field. These comprise the leptons (such as electrons, muons, tauons) and quarks (the components of protons and neutrons).

<!--list-separator-->

-  The spin one-half comes from the fact that the weights of the spinor representation of \\[SO(1, N-1)\\] are half-integers.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Page 11 / 12

<!--list-separator-->

-  In even dimensions, the spin bundle decomposes as \\[\hat{S} = \hat{S}\_+ \oplus \hat{S}\_-\\]. A physical field that is a section of \\[ \hat{S}\_+ \\] or \\[ \hat{S}\_\* \\] is a fermi field with the respective ****chirality****, \\[\pm\\].

<!--list-separator-->

-  Since the CPT theorem among others requires fermi fields to be real, in four dimensions, we introduce both \\[\psi\\] and \\[\tilde{\psi}\\] as sections of \\[ \hat{S}\_+ \\] or \\[ \hat{S}\_\* \\] . This would be true in all \\[4 k \\] dimensions but different in \\[4k+2\\] dimensions since in that case the \\[S\\] are both real.

-  The Dirac equation takes the form

        -  For the so-called Dirac operator \\[D = \Gamma^i D\_i\\] where \\[D\_i\\] is the covariant derivative. This operator decomposes in even dimensions as \\[D = D\_+ \oplus D\_-\\] where \\[D\_\* \colon \hat{S}\_+ \rightarrow \hat{S}\_-\\] and \\[D\_+ \colon \hat{S}\_\* \rightarrow \hat{S}\_+\\]

### There must be some more economical structure at a more elementary level.

### At first sight, one might believe that it is preposterous to imagine that the world is ten dimensional. The world seems to be ‘obviously’ four dimensional (if one includes time along with the three obvious space dimensions). The following is crucial, however. We tend to take for granted that there is some notion of ‘empty space’ and that any other physical state is obtained by adding particles to ‘empty space.’ In reality, though, what we interpret.as empty space is just some solution of the underlying physical equations which plays a special role in our experience. The reason that there is a solution playing such a special role is largely that the energy scales of our experiments are so small compared to the Planck mass. The tools at our disposal are so feeble that we can bring about only minor disturbances in whatever solution of the underlying equations we happen to have been born into. {#at-first-sight-one-might-believe-that-it-is-preposterous-to-imagine-that-the-world-is-ten-dimensional-dot-the-world-seems-to-be-obviously-four-dimensional--if-one-includes-time-along-with-the-three-obvious-space-dimensions--dot-the-following-is-crucial-however-dot-we-tend-to-take-for-granted-that-there-is-some-notion-of-empty-space-and-that-any-other-physical-state-is-obtained-by-adding-particles-to-empty-space-dot-in-reality-though-what-we-interpret-dot-as-empty-space-is-just-some-solution-of-the-underlying-physical-equations-which-plays-a-special-role-in-our-experience-dot-the-reason-that-there-is-a-solution-playing-such-a-special-role-is-largely-that-the-energy-scales-of-our-experiments-are-so-small-compared-to-the-planck-mass-dot-the-tools-at-our-disposal-are-so-feeble-that-we-can-bring-about-only-minor-disturbances-in-whatever-solution-of-the-underlying-equations-we-happen-to-have-been-born-into-dot}
