### "The paper shows that it is possible to arrive at the same solution for causal problems using both the do-calculus and Bayesian theory. The key insight required for the Bayesian formulation is that the probabilistic graphical model must jointly model both the pre-intervention and post intervention worlds" {#the-paper-shows-that-it-is-possible-to-arrive-at-the-same-solution-for-causal-problems-using-both-the-do-calculus-and-bayesian-theory-dot-the-key-insight-required-for-the-bayesian-formulation-is-that-the-probabilistic-graphical-model-must-jointly-model-both-the-pre-intervention-and-post-intervention-worlds}
