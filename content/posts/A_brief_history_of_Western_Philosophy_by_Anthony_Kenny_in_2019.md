### 17.1 Fichte {#17-dot-1-fichte}


### 17.2 Hegel {#17-dot-2-hegel}

<!--list-separator-->

-  The subject matter of logic is ****the Absolute, the totality of reality,**** familiar to us from earlier philosophers as ****Being****. We start from the thesis that the Absolute is pure Being. But pure Being without any qualities is nothing; so we are led to the antithesis ‘The Absolute is nothing’. This thesis and antithesis are overcome by synthesis: <span class="underline"><span class="underline">the union of Being and Unbeing is becoming</span></span>, and so we say ****‘The Absolute is Becoming’.****

<!--list-separator-->

-  Hegel does make use of Aristotle’s definition of God when he describes the Absolute as being the Thought which thinks itself. But it turns out that the self-awareness of the Absolute comes at the end, not at the beginning, of this life-cycle, and it is brought into existence by the philosophical reflection of human beings. It is the history of philosophy which brings the Absolute face to face with itself.


### 17.3 Marx and the Young Hegelians {#17-dot-3-marx-and-the-young-hegelians}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Marx divided the past, present, and future history of the relations of production into six phases: primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, socialism, and ultimate communism

<!--list-separator-->

-  He based this conclusion on two economic theories: the labour theory of value, and the theory of surplus value.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Under capitalism, however, prices in the market are determined not by true value, but by supply and demand. The capitalist, who owns the raw material and the means of production, having paid the worker a wage equal to his day’s subsistence, say 1, can often sell the product for many times that sum, say 10. The difference between the subsistence wage and the market price is the surplus value, in this case 9. Under capitalism, no part ofthis surplus value is returned to the worker, it is all pocketed by the employer. The effect is that only one-tenth ofthe labourer’s work is for his own benefit; nine-tenths of it is just to produce profit for the capitalist.

-  Its central doctrine is the picture theory of meaning. According to this theory, language consists of propositions which picture the world. Propositions are the perceptible expressions of thoughts, and thoughts are logical pictures of facts; the world is the totality of facts.

### 25.7 The Cartesian revival {#25-dot-7-the-cartesian-revival}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Philosophers who have been convinced by Wittgenstein see qualia as just the latest example of the ineffable private experiences that the private language argument was supposed to have killed off. But certainly in the United States many philosophers appear comfortable with the idea, and it has been passed on also to neuroscientists, many of whom have thereby become unconscious dualists. Many philosophers and psychologists believe that the task of a scientific theory of the mind is to establish a principle of correlation between the occurrence of mental states and processes and the occurrence of states and processes in the brain. This correlation would only be a possibility if mental events (e.g. thoughts, or flashes of understanding) were them? selves measureable in the way in which physical events are measurable.

### 25.10 [Richard Rorty]({{< relref "Richard_Rorty" >}}) {#25-dot-10-richard-rorty--richard-rorty-dot-md}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Mainstream, systematic philosophy aims at truth, but there is another form of philosophy that aims at self-formation, which Rorty styles ‘edification’. ****Edification**** is a project of finding new, better, more interesting, more fruitful ways of speaking. Edifying philosophers are sceptical about systematic philosophy.

<!--list-separator-->

-  ‘Great systematic philosophers, like great scientists, build for eternity. Great edifying philosophers destroy for the sake of their own generation.’

<!--list-separator-->

-  one can concede to [Rorty] that Descartes did great damage to philosophy by giving it an epistemological turn without agreeing that the damage is irreparable. It is, in fact, possible to return to the pre-Cartesian, Aristotelian conception of human nature, and it is perfectly arguable that this was what that great edifier Wittgenstein actually achieved.

<!--list-separator-->

-  ‘What has to be overcome is not a difficulty of the understanding, but of the will. The job to be done is really a job on oneself.’
