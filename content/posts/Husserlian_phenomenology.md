## conceptual sketch {#conceptual-sketch}


### subjects perceive phenomena, which they turn into noema {#subjects-perceive-phenomena-which-they-turn-into-noema}


### noema:: concepts or mental representations of phenomena {#noema-concepts-or-mental-representations-of-phenomena}


### noesis:: phenomena --> noema {#noesis-phenomena-noema}

<!--list-separator-->

-  noesis is a function that maps phenomena to noema


### when we attempt to apply noesis to noesis recursively, we get noema again and end up resolving this with a need to presuppose the existence of a subject {#when-we-attempt-to-apply-noesis-to-noesis-recursively-we-get-noema-again-and-end-up-resolving-this-with-a-need-to-presuppose-the-existence-of-a-subject}
