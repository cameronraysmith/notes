-  At the extremes, British Absolute Idealists thought of all relations as internal (Russell’s “world as a bowl of jelly”) and atomists thought of all relations as external (Russell’s “world as a bucket of shot”). Whitehead cited both as united in committing the “[fallacy of lost contrast](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressed%5Fcorrelative>).” The fallacy of lost contrast is also known as the [suppressed correlative]({{< relref "suppressed_correlative" >}})
