### My name is [Du Phan]({{< relref "Du_Phan" >}}). I got my PhD in Mathematics and Data Science fromÂ [POSTECH](<http://postech.ac.kr/eng/>), South Korea. I have a deep interest in machine learning, deep learning, and recently Bayesian statistics. Having learned a lot from free resources on the internet, I hope that with this blog, I can contribute my knowledge back to the community. {#my-name-is-du-phan--du-phan-dot-md--dot-i-got-my-phd-in-mathematics-and-data-science-from-postech--http-postech-dot-ac-dot-kr-eng--south-korea-dot-i-have-a-deep-interest-in-machine-learning-deep-learning-and-recently-bayesian-statistics-dot-having-learned-a-lot-from-free-resources-on-the-internet-i-hope-that-with-this-blog-i-can-contribute-my-knowledge-back-to-the-community-dot}
