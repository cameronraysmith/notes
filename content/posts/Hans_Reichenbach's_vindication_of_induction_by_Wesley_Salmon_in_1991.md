## Heard about the notion of vindication of induction in [Bayesian informal logic and fallacy by Kevin Korb in 2003]({{< relref "Bayesian_informal_logic_and_fallacy_by_Kevin_Korb_in_2003" >}}) {#heard-about-the-notion-of-vindication-of-induction-in-bayesian-informal-logic-and-fallacy-by-kevin-korb-in-2003--bayesian-informal-logic-and-fallacy-by-kevin-korb-in-2003-dot-md}


## "Over time and place, the reasons Reichenbach gives for convergence of frequency estimates to a limiting value vary, including 1) his early view that convergence is synthetic a priori, or that 2) the principle of induction expresses a kind of psychological habit, 3) the semantic argument we quoted above in Section 2.2 that the negation of the principle of induction is meaningless, 4) a pragmatic vindication that induction using the straight rule works if any method of induction works, 5) a convergence argument based on higher order probabilities, or 6) that there is no guarantee, merely “posits.”" {#over-time-and-place-the-reasons-reichenbach-gives-for-convergence-of-frequency-estimates-to-a-limiting-value-vary-including-1-his-early-view-that-convergence-is-synthetic-a-priori-or-that-2-the-principle-of-induction-expresses-a-kind-of-psychological-habit-3-the-semantic-argument-we-quoted-above-in-section-2-dot-2-that-the-negation-of-the-principle-of-induction-is-meaningless-4-a-pragmatic-vindication-that-induction-using-the-straight-rule-works-if-any-method-of-induction-works-5-a-convergence-argument-based-on-higher-order-probabilities-or-6-that-there-is-no-guarantee-merely-posits-dot}
