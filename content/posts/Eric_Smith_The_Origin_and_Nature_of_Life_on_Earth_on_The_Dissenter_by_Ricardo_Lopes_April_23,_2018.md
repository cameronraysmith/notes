## Quotes {#quotes}

-   56:42 "Everything that physics did in the 20th century to understand the structure of matter we need to do again to understand the structure of processes, and I think then we will begin to have the right mathematics and physics to talk about living systems. That's going to be very rich because the space of processes is much bigger than the space of materials and chemistry is much bigger in its complexity than the parts of the vacuum that we've understood so far. So this is going to be a lot of work and I'm sure it will include a great many new concepts that we didn't know exist in the universe before now."
