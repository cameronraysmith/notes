## recall the units of the fundamental constants \\[G\\] and \\[\hbar\\] {#recall-the-units-of-the-fundamental-constants-g-and-hbar}


### \\[\hbar \; [=] \; \frac{m \times l^2}{t}=J \cdot s\\] {#hbar-frac-m-times-l-2-t-j-cdot-s}


### \\[G \; [=] \; \frac{l^3}{m \times t^2}\\] {#g-frac-l-3-m-times-t-2}


### note \\[l\\] is length \\[m\\] is mass, and \\[t\\] is time {#note-l-is-length-m-is-mass-and-t-is-time}


## give the Planck length, time, mass, and energy in terms of \\[G\\], \\[\hbar\\], and \\[c\\]. {#give-the-planck-length-time-mass-and-energy-in-terms-of-g-hbar-and-c-dot}

### Note: This is a somewhat particle physics-influenced view of the world. Recent times have seen tremendous progress on ^^the in-between areas of this map such as condensed matter systems, statistical mechanics, and biophysics which are distinguished less by their scale as by the complexity of their interactions^^. {#note-this-is-a-somewhat-particle-physics-influenced-view-of-the-world-dot-recent-times-have-seen-tremendous-progress-on-the-in-between-areas-of-this-map-such-as-condensed-matter-systems-statistical-mechanics-and-biophysics-which-are-distinguished-less-by-their-scale-as-by-the-complexity-of-their-interactions-dot}
