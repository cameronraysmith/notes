* L6. Topological manifolds and manifold bundles
** 3. Topological manifolds and bundles
*** 3.1 Definition and construction of topological manifolds
*** 3.2 Bundles
**** A bundle (of topological manifolds) is a triple $$(E, \pi, M)$$
***** $$E$$ is a topological manifold called the total space
***** $$M$$ is a topological manifold called the base space
***** $$\pi : E \rightarrow M$$ is a continuous surjective map from the total space onto the base space
**** Let $$p \in M$$, then $$\pi^{-1}(p) = F_p$$ is called the fiber at $$p$$
**** 
* L7. Differentiable structures definition and classification
* L19. Principal fiber bundles
** left and right Lie group actions; 
*** example: actions from representations; 
*** proof: right actions from left actions;

*** detailed example: the frame bundle; 
** principal bundle morphisms and isomorphisms (or diffeomorphisms);

* L22. Local representations of a connection on the base manifold: Yang-Mills fields
