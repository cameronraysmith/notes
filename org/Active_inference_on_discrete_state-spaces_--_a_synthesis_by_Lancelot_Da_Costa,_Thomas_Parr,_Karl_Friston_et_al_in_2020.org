* 1. Introduction
** **Active inference** is a normative principle regarding **cognitive processes**
*** perception
*** action
*** planning
*** decision-making
*** learning
** **Active inference** postulates that **cognitive processes** may all be seen as **optimizing two** complementary **objective functions**
*** a variational form of ^^free energy^^
**** measures the fit between an internal model and past sensory observations
*** an expected ^^free energy^^
**** scores possible future courses of action in relation to prior preferences
** An internal forward generative model is used to predict sensory input, which allows for the inference of the causes of that sensory data
