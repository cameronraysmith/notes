* This technical report describes a dynamic causal model of the spread of coronavirus through a population. The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes.__ — via [[https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/covid-19/][Dynamic Causal Modelling of COVID-19]]
* Introduction
** Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) refers to the characterisation of coupled dynamical systems in terms of how observable data are generated by unobserved (i.e., latent or hidden) causes

*** **Dynamic causal modelling** subsumes 
**** **state estimation** and 
**** **system identification** 
*** under one Bayesian procedure, to provide probability densities over
******unknown latent states (i.e., state estimation)** and 
**** **model parameters (i.e., system identification)**, 
*** respectively. Its **focus** is on **estimating the uncertainty about these estimates** to **quantify the evidence for competing models**, and the **confidence in various predictions.**
