* Extraction notes
- Blooming Allonge
  + start around 13B and decrease by 1-3 fine-grained adjustment increments until achieving a stable 5-6 bar post-bloom pressure
- TURBO
  + start around 15B and decrease by one coarse-grained adjustment increment until the pressure profile appropriately reaches 6 bar and extraction time is less than 35 seconds. If uncertain, better to err slightly on the too fine side as the pressure control will just extract at a slower rate (but definitely too fine if it is taking more than 35 seconds to get a 2:1 extraction).
