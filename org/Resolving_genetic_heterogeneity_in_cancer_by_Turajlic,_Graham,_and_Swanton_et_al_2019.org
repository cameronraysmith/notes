#+TITLE: Resolving genetic heterogeneity in cancer by Turajlic, Graham, and Swanton et al 2019
* Is cancer a special case of evolution?
** Subclones * subpopulations of cells within a tumor distinguished by genetic alterations and growth rates
** [[file:asexual_evolution.org][asexual evolution]]
*** replication
*** heritable variation
*** genetic drift
*** selection
** 
* Current models of tumor evolution
** Selection
** Branching evolution
** Linear evolution
** Neutral evolution
** Punctuated evolution
* Inferring evolutionary mode with genomics
** Bulk sequencing
** Choice of sequencing assay
** Allelic copy number correction
** Single-cell sequencing
* Detecting selection
** Using clone frequency to detect selection
** Using mutational patterns to detect selection
** Stochasticity versus determinism
* Chromosome instability in cancer evolution
** CIN and clonal fitness
** CIN and metastasis
** CIN and clinical outcomes
* Evolutionary patterns and patient outcomes
** Clonal diversity and clinical outcomes
** Punctuated versus gradual evolution and clinical outcomes
* Origin of treatment-resistant clones
** Resistance to targeted therapies
** Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition
* Conclusions and perspective
