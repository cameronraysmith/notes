* a minimal model or Virasoro minimal model is a two-dimensional [[file:conformal_field_theory.org][conformal field theory]] whose spectrum is built from finitely many irreducible representations of the Virasoro algebra. Minimal models have been classified and solved, and found to obey an ADE classification.
