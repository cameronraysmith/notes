* First heard of this in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcFLQvz5uEg&t=844s][Mindscape 87 | Karl Friston on Brains, Predictions, and Free Energy]] the Mindscape podcast episode interviewing [[file:Karl_Friston.org][Karl Friston]] on <2020-03-09 Mon>
* Considered here as that developed by [[file:Karl_Friston.org][Karl Friston]] originally (to the best of my knowledge as of <2020-05-14 Thu>) in [[file:A_theory_of_cortical_responses_by_Karl_Friston_in_2005.org][A theory of cortical responses by Karl Friston in 2005]] and most recently in [[file:A_free_energy_principle_for_a_particular_physics_by_Karl_Friston_in_2019.org][A free energy principle for a particular physics by Karl Friston in 2019]]

** At the core of the background necessary to understand the [[file:free_energy_principle.org][free energy principle]] is the relationship between free energy as it is used in [[file:statistical_physics.org][statistical physics]] versus its use in [[file:probabilistic_inference.org][probabilistic inference]] which is encapsulated in the notion of [[file:variational_inference.org][variational inference]]. The best explanation I know of this relationship is in the formulation of Gibbs free energy via a variational principle in [[file:Information,_physics,_and_computation_by_Marc_Mezard_and_Andrea_Montanari_in_2009.org][Information, physics, and computation by Marc Mezard and Andrea Montanari in 2009]].
** What is the relationship between the free energy principle and [[file:active_inference.org][active inference]]?
