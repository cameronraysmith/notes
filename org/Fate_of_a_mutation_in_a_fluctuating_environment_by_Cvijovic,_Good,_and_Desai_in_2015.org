#+TITLE: Fate of a mutation in a fluctuating environment by Cvijovic, Good, and Desai in 2015
* Model
** Fig. 1. Fitness and frequency trajectories.
** We neglect longer-term changes in discrete environmental epochs (Fig. 1A). Through the bulk of selection pressures, so that s(t) will fluctuate between s1 and s2 in discrete environmental epochs
** Timescales of environmental variation
** An effective diffusion process
* Heuristic analysis
** The reduced efficiency of selection
** The role of seasonal drift
* Formal analysis
* Discussion
* Supplement
** The Effective Diffusion Regime
*** Fast Switching [$$s \tau \ll 1 \ll 2 \log(Ns)$$]
*** Slow switching [$$1 \ll \tau \ll 2 \log(Ns)$$]
*** Unequal epochs ($$\tau_1 \neq \tau_2$$)
*** Recurrent mutation ($$N \mu \gg 1$$)
** Beyond the effective diffusion regime
*** Fixation during the first epoch [$$1 \ll 2 \log (Ns) \ll s \tau$$]
*** Substantial average fitness effects ( $$\bar{s} \tau \gtrsim 1$$)
*** Substantial variation in epoch lengths ($$s \delta \tau \gg 1$$)
** Relation to previous work
