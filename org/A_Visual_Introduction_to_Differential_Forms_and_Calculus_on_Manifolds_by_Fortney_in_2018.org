#+TITLE: A Visual Introduction to Differential Forms and Calculus on Manifolds by Fortney in 2018
* Book review

  - As another comparison, this does what
    *Shashahani's recent graduate text
    does for advanced material * it shows pictures of the ideas mostly as illustrations of surfaces in R^3 for you to generalize from, without falling into the temptation to turn the text entirely in that direction like Thorpe did, gradient normals and all.

    Does it fill the need to go beyond recent texts like
    *Vector Calculus vs. Vector Analysis or
    *A Geometric Approach to Differential Forms
    to become the badly needed link to graduate and research-level material in
    *Conlon?
    No. There is still a hole here, one that
    *O'Neill or
    *Weintraub tried to bridge from the beginner's side and one that
    *Janich and Loring Tu's
    near-perfect standard try to bridge over from the *advanced* side.

    Instead, this is more on the level * and, with hopefully upcoming edits, quality * of
    *Walchap or
    *O'Neill or
    *Grinfeld's Tensor Calculus,
    all three of which should absolutely be purchased by the beginner along with this volume for a short library that gets started with the topic. The suggested reading index of this book, by the way, is a great place to start building a large list!

- Let $\{e_i | i=1, \ldots, n \}$ denote an orthonormal basis for $T_p \mathbb{R}^n$
- $v_p[f] = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i \cdot \partial_{x_i} f \vert_{p}$
- Viewing a vector in the tangent space as acting on a function via the directional derivative leads to the equation of vectors with partial differential operators. That is to say, for example, $e_i = \partial_{x_i}$ in the sense that, given an arbitrary real-valued function $f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ on the manifold $\mathbb{R}^n$, $e_i[f]= \partial_{x_i} (f)$.
