* 0. Abstract
** (i) to describe within a single article the mathematical structure of this implementation of the FEP; 
** (ii) provide a simple but complete agent-based model utilising the FEP and 
** (iii) to disclose the assumption structure of this implementation of the FEP to help elucidate its significance for the brain sciences.
* 1. Introduction
** The FEP has an extensive historical pedigree. Some see its origins starting with Helmholtzâ€™ proposal that perceptions are extracted from sensory data by probabilistic modelling of their causes (Von Helmholtz & Southall, 2005).
** 
* 2. An overview of the FEP
** 2.1 R* and G-densities
** 2.2 Minimizing free energy
** 2.3 The action-perception cycle
** 2.4 Predictive coding
** 2.5 A technical guide
*** We show how minimising VFE has two consequences.
**** First, it makes the R-density a better estimate of posterior beliefs about environmental state given sensory data, thus implementing approximate Bayesian inference. 
**** Second, it makes the VFE itself an upper-bound on sensory surprisal.
*** 
* 3. Variational free energy
* 4. The R-density: how the brain encodes environmental states
* 5. The G-density: encoding the brains beliefs about environmental causes
** 5.1 The simplest generative model
** 5.2 A dynamical generative model
* 6. VFE minimization: how organisms infer environmental states
* 7. Active inference
* 8. Hierarchical inference and learning
** 8.1 Hierarchical generative model
** 8.2 Combining hierarchical and dynamical models: the full construct
** 8.3 The full-construct recognition dynamics and neuronal activity
** 8.4 Parameters and hyperparameters: synaptic efficacy and gain
** 8.5 Active inference on the full construct
* 9. Discussion
** 
* Appendices
** A. Variational Bayes: ensemble learning
** B. Dynamic Bayesian thermostat
