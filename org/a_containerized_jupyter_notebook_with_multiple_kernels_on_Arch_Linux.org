* doom emacs
   + should put a custom version of my =doom.d= directory into the default =dotfiles-local= of the =notebooks= repository which should eliminate the steps below
     - needed to have =cmake= installed so this should be added to packages
     - realized that I needed =wget= to download [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/issues/2204#issuecomment-626654221][doom black hole image]], which doesn't get used properly but would probably lead the config to cause an error
     - had to add paths such as =~/projects/notes/org/private/agenda=,  =~/org/bib/=, =~/Downloads/figures/= for compatibility with my =doom.d= configuration
     - had to clone my =dotfiles-local= repository and then copy the =doom.d= directory into the remote machine's copy of =dotfiles-local=, run =rcup=, and then run ~emacs.d/bin/doom sync~.
   + had to use =SPC := to call =M-x=
   + had to hard link any shared github repositories containing org files into =projects/notes/org/=
   + used =global-command-log-mode= and set =command-log-mode-window-size= to =60= instead of =40=
