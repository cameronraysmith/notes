#+TITLE: Embodying probabilistic inference in biochemical circuits by Yarden Katz, Michael Springer, and Walter Fontana in 2018
* Introduction
* Analysis 
** Real-time probabilistic inference in a changing environment
** Representing a changing environment using sensors, recorders and integrators
** Programmatic generation of a biochemical circuit that performs inference
** Embodied inference is constrained by the logic of protein production
*** Properties of an inferential mechanism
*** Coupling of inference and action
*** Constraints of embodiment by proteins
*** Variation in coupling inference to action
*** Relationship to idealized inference
** Circuit failure modes
** Searching for the molecular correlates of inference
* Discussion
