#+TITLE: natural units
* recall the units of the fundamental constants $$G$$ and $$\hbar$$
** $$\hbar \; [=] \; \frac{m \times l^2}{t}=J \cdot s$$
** $$G \; [=] \; \frac{l^3}{m \times t^2}$$
** note $$l$$ is length $$m$$ is mass, and $$t$$ is time
* give the Planck length, time, mass, and energy in terms of $$G$$, $$\hbar$$, and $$c$$.
** $$L_p = \sqrt{\frac{G \hbar}{c^3}}$$
** $$T_p = \sqrt{\frac{G \hbar}{c^5}}$$
** $$M_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}$$
** $$E_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}}$$

** Note: This is a somewhat particle physics-influenced view of the world. Recent times have seen tremendous progress on ^^the in-between areas of this map such as condensed matter systems, statistical mechanics, and biophysics which are distinguished less by their scale as by the complexity of their interactions^^.
