**** Determine an evolution equation for the density field $$\rho(\mathbf{r},t)$$
***** Parameters
****** for each particle already present in the system, a new particle is created with probability $$\kappa$$ per unit time
***** Reactions
****** $$A \longrightarrow 2A$$ at rate $$\kappa$$
****** $$A \longrightarrow 0$$ at rate $$\nu$$
****** $$2A \longrightarrow A$$ at rate $$\lambda$$
***** Terms
****** Linear
******* the rate of change of the density resulting from the reaction $$A \longrightarrow 2A$$ is $$\kappa \rho$$
******* the rate of change of the density resulting from the reaction $$A \longrightarrow 0$$ is $$-\nu \rho$$
******* the rate of change of the density resulting from diffusion of particles $$A$$ in space with a diffusion coefficient $$D$$ is $$D \Delta \rho$$ where $$\Delta$$ is the Laplacian operator $$\Delta = \nabla^2$$
****** Nonlinear
******* an approximation to the rate of change of the density resulting from the reaction $$2A \longrightarrow A$$ is $$-\lambda \rho^2$$
***** Dynamics
****** $$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = (\kappa * \nu)\rho * \lambda \rho^2 + D \Delta \rho$$
