* 5_7 Massively Parallel Sequencing
** Think about the following questions. Hopefully, you'll know the answers to all of these questions by the end of the day.
*** 1. Massively parallel sequencing libraries are constructed using 100 ng of genomic DNA (which is ~12,000 cells worth of DNA) with the aim of providing an average of 100-fold autosomal coverage for WES and 30-fold coverage for WGS. What fraction of the starting diploid genomes has actually been sequenced?
*** 2. What data filtering steps can be applied to reduce the chance of incorrectly identifying a sequencing error or artifact as being a real DNA variant?
*** 3. How does fold-coverage influence the ability to determine whether an individual is heterozygous for single nucleotide variant?
*** 4. How is fold-coverage used to search for deletions and duplications using WGS and WES sequencing data? What factors can influence the sensitivity and specificity of identifying deletions/duplications?
*** 5. What are the differences between targeted capture, whole exome, whole genome, and RNA sequencing? Which method is most reliable for detecting a de novo DNA rearrangement?
