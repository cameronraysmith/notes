#+TITLE: On the Classification of Dynamical Systems by Chris Zeeman in 1988
* One is emboldened to **raise the question of classifying all ordinary differential equations**. Of course, such a task is impossible because it is too complicated, so perhaps we should first try and classify the 'generic' ones. Since any higher order equation can be written as a first order equation on a higher dimensional manifold **the problem reduces to the classification of vector fields on a manifold**. So let V denote the space of smooth vector fields on a manifold X. **What should a classification programme consist of?** We suggest four steps:
** 1. Choose an equivalence relation on V, and define a vector field to be stable if it has a neighbourhood of equivalents in V. 
** 2. Prove that the stables are dense in V. 
** 3. Classify the stable classes. 
** 4. Classify the unstable classes of codimension 1,2,..., etc.
