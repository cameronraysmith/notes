#+TITLE: Information Theory for Fields by Torsten Enslin in 2019
* 1. Information field theory
** 1.1 Aim
** 1.2 Structure of the work
*** In this Sect. 1, the problem of field inference is approached with Bayesian probability theory.
*** In Sect. 2, the free theory of IFT is developed using an illustrative example of a diffusion process driven by white noise and observed at some point in time.
*** In Sect. 3, this is then extended into the non-linear regime, leading to interacting IFT in wich the field estimate is not a linear function of the data any more.
*** Sect. 4 IFT algorithms and their numerical implementation.
*** Sect. 5 future developments in IFT
