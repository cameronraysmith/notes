** My name is [[http://postech.ac.kr/eng/][[file:Du_Phan.org][Du Phan]]. I got my PhD in Mathematics and Data Science fromÂ [POSTECH]], South Korea. I have a deep interest in machine learning, deep learning, and recently Bayesian statistics. Having learned a lot from free resources on the internet, I hope that with this blog, I can contribute my knowledge back to the community.
