** "Computational approaches to intrinsic motivations (Oudeyer and Kaplan, 2009; Schmidhuber, 2010; Santucci et al., 2013) can be categorized roughly by the psychological motivations they are imitating, e.g., drives to manipulate and explore, the reduction of cognitive dissonance, the achievement of optimal incongruity, and finally motivations for effectance, personal causation, competence and self-determination."
