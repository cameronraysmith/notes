#+TITLE: Tumour heterogeneity and the evolutionary trade-offs of cancer by Hausser and Alon in 2020
* Software being advertised
** Pareto task inference software package, Matlab implementation: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/UriAlon/download/ParTI
** An implementation of Pareto task inference for the r software: https://github.com/vitkl/ParetoTI 
** the iMAXt Grand challenge: https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/imaxt-laboratory/the-project
* Introduction
* Multi-task evolutionary theory
** Trade-offs can result in a continuum of states inside a polyhedron
** Heterogeneity and spatiotemporal variations in selection
** ParTI infers tasks and trade-offs from large-scale data
** Practical caveats of analyzing cancer data with ParTI
* Intertumor diversity
** Tumors share five universal cancer tasks
** Driver mutations tune gene expression towards specialization
* Intratumor heterogeneity
** Spatial organization can maximize total tissue performance
** Towards a multi-task evolution theory of tumor spatial heterogeneity
* Conclusions and perspectives
