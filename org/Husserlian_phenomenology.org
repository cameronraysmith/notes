#+TITLE: Husserlian phenomenology
* conceptual sketch
** subjects perceive phenomena, which they turn into noema
** noema:: concepts or mental representations of phenomena
** noesis:: phenomena --> noema
*** noesis is a function that maps phenomena to noema
** when we attempt to apply noesis to noesis recursively, we get noema again and end up resolving this with a need to presuppose the existence of a subject
*** see the reference to The Phenomenological Reduction of Science by Max Scheler in 1929
