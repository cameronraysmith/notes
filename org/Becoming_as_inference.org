* historical note
** I originally connected these ideas on <2020-07-13 Mon> and decided to continue this line of thinking under the title of this page [[file:Becoming_as_inference.org][Becoming as inference]] on <2020-07-20 Mon>.
* brief description
** If we just try to describe what scientists do without examining the internal experience they have, then we think of them as constructing models and performing Bayesian model selection and parametric inference. In addition to this explicit application of [[file:probabilistic_inference.org][probabilistic inference]], we also have a model of the implicit functioning of the brain that considers it as a device that performs [[file:probabilistic_inference.org][probabilistic inference]], which has been associated with several different names including the [[file:predictive_coding_model.org][predictive coding model]], [[file:Bayesian_brain_hypothesis.org][Bayesian brain hypothesis]], [[file:prediction_error_minimization.org][prediction error minimization]] framework, or the [[file:free_energy_principle.org][free energy principle]]. If we consider the functioning of simple organisms in this same context, we can construct an analogy to the [[file:Bayesian_brain_hypothesis.org][Bayesian brain hypothesis]] that results in various additional Bayesian `X` hypotheses such as the [[file:Bayesian_biology_hypothesis.org][Bayesian biology hypothesis]], the [[file:Bayesian_chemistry_hypothesis.org][Bayesian chemistry hypothesis]], [[file:Quantum_Bayesianism.org][Quantum Bayesianism]], and so on.

On one hand this suggests that developing a sufficiently flexible framework for describing the processes within which [[file:probabilistic_inference.org][probabilistic inference]] occurs is potentially fundamental. On another, it may be that at this level of abstraction doing so would eventually appear vacuous.
** pan-inferentialism, the notion that [[file:probabilistic_inference.org][probabilistic inference]] is embodied by [[file:dynamical_systems.org][dynamical systems]] and unifies the curiosity of humans as manifest in the experience of scientists with the models they create of the functioning of physical and biological systems
