* Hosted Service

In addition to running the software locally as detailed below, you also have the option of using the hosted service:

[[https://notebook.gcloud.probcomp.net][Probcomp Notebook]]
* Access is controlled by membership in the [[https://github.com/probcomp][probcomp GitHub org]].
* 96 CPU cores, 360GB of RAM
* 10GB persistent disk
* One hour browser-based inactivity timeout
* 10 max concurrent instances

A [[https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html][JupyterLab]] mode is also available which supports additional functionality like [[https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html][system shell terminals]]. To use lab, change the `tree` in the URL to `lab` after your notebook starts. ex: `https://notebook.gcloud.probcomp.net/user/avinson/tree` -> `https://notebook.gcloud.probcomp.net/user/avinson/lab`.
