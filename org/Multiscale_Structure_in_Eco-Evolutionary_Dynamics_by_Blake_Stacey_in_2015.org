#+TITLE: Multiscale Structure in Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics by Blake Stacey in 2015
* [[file:stochastic_processes.org][stochastic processes]], [[file:renormalization.org][renormalization]], [[file:papers.org][papers]]
* this is the PhD thesis of [[file:Blake_Stacey.org][Blake Stacey]]. it is tagged as a [[file:papers.org][papers]] because it is in the mendeley papers library as opposed to the book even though, as a thesis, it really is better classified as a book
