#+TITLE: Quantum Processes A Whiteheadian Interpretation of Quantum Field Theory by Frank Hattich
* I. Whitehead's process philosophy
** 1. Actuality
*** Overview
**** Ontology
***** actuality
***** potentiality
**** Connection
***** actuality --> potentiality
****** what exists by way of potentiality is limited or conditioned by actuality
***** potentiality --> actuality
****** what exists by way of actuality arises out of what exists by way of potentiality  
**** Actuality
***** actual occasions = actual entities are the building blocks of actuality
****** there is a process of coming into being (=becoming) of final actualities but they do not arise from nothing
****** each instance is both a becoming and a being: first it is a becoming and then the being that is created by that act of becoming
**** Potentialities
***** eternal potentials ground the becoming of actualities
**** Questions
***** What secures the self-identity of an occasion?
****** In the two different stages of its existence one could consider two distinct entities: the former in the state of becoming to create the latter in the state of being
***** When can the becoming of an occasion be said to create its being?

*** Overview
**** An influence of gravitationally interacting matter on the structure of spacetime, like the one described in the macro-realm by the general theory of relativity, is to be expected. But since QFT presupposes a given spacetime as a fixed, unchangeable background structure, its conceptual framework is simply too narrow for being able to include the gravitational interaction.
*** 4.1 The Lagrangian approach
**** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haag%27s_theorem][Haag's theorem]] states that a nonperturbative interacting QFT does not exist in a rigorous mathematical sense within the framework used in the Lagrangian approach
**** the very idea of a quantum field (i.e. a “quantized” classical field) as an assignment of an operator Ψ(x) to each spacetime point x is not tenable from a mathematical point of view.
**** The strategy of the AQFTs was to isolate those features of QFT which could be stated in mathematically rigorous terms and to extract those general postulates which looked trustworthy in the light of the lessons learned from the Lagrangian approach.
*** 4.2 The axiomatic approach
**** Wightman axioms
**** Quantum fields are operator-valued distributions that become well-defined operators in the Hilbert space of state vectors $$\mathcal{H}$$ when being smeared with an appropriate test function $$f$$ with support in an extended region of spacetime $$\mathcal{O}$$
***** $$\Psi(f) = \int \Psi(x) f(x) dx$$
**** Borchers’ result showed that different quantum fields Ψ, Φ can very well lead to the same sets of observables. Since in such a case the observable content of the theory does not depend on the choice of the underlying quantum field Ψ or Φ, this result indicates that a formulation of QFT based on quantum fields contains essential redundancies.
*** 4.3 The algebraic approach
**** The fundamental mathematical structure on which AQFT is based is a correspondence $$\mathcal{O} \mapsto \mathcal{R} (\mathcal{O})$$ between bounded spacetime regions $$\mathcal{O}$$ and operator algebras $$\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{O})$$
**** Self-adjoint elements of the operator algebras are interpreted as the physical magnitudes or observables measurable within spacetime region $$\mathcal{O}$$
**** all relevant physical information is contained in the axioms of AQFT, and thus ultimately in the correspondence between spacetime regions and algebras of observables,
