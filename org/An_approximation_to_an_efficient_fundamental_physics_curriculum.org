* Introduction
* Basic question
* What is an approximation to a physics curriculum that is co-optimized between the goals of being both comprehensive (up to the fringe of existing experimental verification, but not necessarily quite rigorous enough to prepare for original research) and efficient?
** Before reviewing t proposed curriculum it would be reasonable to consider the much broader and more comprehensive perspective from [[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/][Gerard 't Hooft]]: [[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html][How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist]]
* Global perspective
* I think it is helpful to be aware of the following perspectives before getting started
    A quote regarding the relationship between the local and global structure of theoretical physics
        "All of physics has two aspects: a local or even infinitesimal aspect, and a global aspect. Much of the standard lore deals just with the local and infinitesimal aspects -* the __perturbative__ aspects and [[https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/77412/9269][[file:fiber_bundle.org][fiber bundle]]s play little role there. But they are the all-important structure that governs the global -* the __non-perturbative__ -* aspect. Bundles are the __global__ structure of physical fields and they are irrelevant only for the crude local and perturbative description of reality." [Note: Of course...the latter should not be viewed as a __criticism__ as those are the components that support concrete calculations that make direct contact with the analysis of experiments] --[Urs Schreiber response to physics.stackexchange question: Intuitively, why are bundles so important in Physics?]]
    A paragraph written by Edward Witten p. 280 in the 1986 Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians and on p. 20 in [[file:Physics_and_geometry_by_Edward_Witten_in_1986.org][Physics and geometry by Edward Witten in 1986]] (see below) taken with update from [[https://ericweinstein.org][Eric Weinstein's]], [[https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Graph,_Wall,_Tome][The Portal 'Graph, Wall, Tome project']]
        If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are really three fundamental observations
            1. Space-time is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, $$M$$, endowed with a metric tensor and governed by geometrical laws
            2. Over $$M$$ is a principal $$G$$-bundle, $$P_G$$, with a non-Abelian structure group $$G$$
            3. Fermions are sections of $$\hat{S}_+ \otimes V_R \oplus \hat{S}_* \otimes V_{\tilde{R}}$$. $$R$$ and $$\tilde{R}$$ are not isomorphic, but should be complex linear representations of $$G$$
            4. ? Higgs
        All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.

* Evolving pedagogy
* Executable physics for independent verification of understanding concrete computations
** An important goal would be to translate a minimal set of computations from textbook format to an open source computer algebra system such as [Maxima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_software) [[file:maxima.org][maxima]] in [Jupyter](https://github.com/robert-dodier/maxima-jupyter) likely making use of [[https://www.vttoth.com/CMS/projects/61-the-maxima-computer-algebra-system][Viktor Toth's up-to-date implementations of atensor, ctensor, itensor]] ( [[http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0503073)][paper]] )
