** 1. Smooth sets
*** Overview
**** Generalized sets equipped with smooth structure called smooth sets
**** Smooth sets are generalized to smooth homotopy types, smooth h-sets, or smooth 0-types
**** The definition of smooth sets is valuable because it is both simpler and more powerful than those it subsumes, which includes smooth manifolds, Frechet manifolds, and diffeological spaces
**** The category of smooth sets is the topos of sheaves on the gros site of Cartesian spaces that contains as full subcategories smooth manifolds and diffeological spaces
*** 1.1 Abstract coordinate systems
**** Overview
***** Every kind of geometry is modeled on a collection of archetypical basic spaces and geometric homorphisms between them
***** In differential geometry the 
****** 1) archetypical spaces are abstract standard Cartesian coordinate systems, $$\mathbb{R}^n$$
****** 2) archetypical geometric homomorphisms between them are smooth functions $$\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$$ that are sometimes referred to as coordinate transformations
**** 1.1.1 The continuum real line
***** The fundamental premise for using differential geometry as a model of geometry for physics is that the abstract worldline of any particle can be modeled by the continuum real line $$\mathbb{R}$$
