#+TITLE: conformal field theory
* CFTs are [[file:renormalization.org][renormalization]] group fixed points of QFTs
** Studying the space of CFTs basically amounts to studying the space of all well-defined QFTs  [[https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/185493/9269][]]

* Conformal  field  theories  lead  to  highest  weight  representations  of  the  [[file:Virasoro__algebra.org][Virasoro  algebra]],  a  special  case  of  this  being  the  assertion  that  the highest weight  representations  of  affine  Lie  algebras  can  be  extended  to  the  semi-direct  product  with  the Virasoro  algebra. -* p. 46 [[file:Physics_and_geometry_by_Edward_Witten_in_1986.org][Physics and geometry by Edward Witten in 1986]]
