#+TITLE: Process-relational philosophy by C. Robert Mesle in 2008
* 1. A process-relational world: an adventure that matters
** Ideas shape actions, so it matters how we think about reality, the world, and ourselves. I donâ€™t mean that only people who believe in one particular religion or philosophy can be good or intelligent people.
* 2. Imaginative generalization: the search for a comprehensive vision
* 3. Minds, bodies, and experience: envisioning a unified self
* 4. Experience all the way down: seeking an imaginative leap
* 5. Reality as relational process: substance and process
* 6. Reality as a causal web: a constructive postmodernism
* 7. Unilateral power: power, value, and reality
* 8. Relational power: so what?
* 9. Creativity, freedom, and God: what makes freedom possible?
** 
* 10. Looking ahead: the future of process-relational thought
* Appendix: Whitehead's language
