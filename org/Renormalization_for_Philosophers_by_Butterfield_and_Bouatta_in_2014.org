* 1. Introduction
** 
* 2. Renormalization: the traditional approach
** 2.1 Prospectus: corrections needed
** 2.2 Renormalizing a coupling constant
*** 2.2.1 Virtual particles and perturbation theory
*** 2.2.2 Energy scales
*** 2.2.3 Some details
** 2.3 The cut-off introduced
** 2.4 Letting the cut-off $$d$$ go to zero
** 2.5 The need for extra terms
*** 2.5.1 The physical rationale
*** 2.5.2 A refined definition of renormalizability
** 2.6 Which theories are renormalizable?
*** 2.6.1 Dyson's criterion
*** 2.6.2 Our good fortune
* 3. The modern approach to renormalization
** 3.1 Good fortune explained: non-renormalizable terms dwindle at longer distances
*** 3.1.1 Decoupling high-energy behaviour
*** 3.1.2 Spacetime need not be a continuum
*** 3.1.3 Effective theories only?
*** 3.1.4 The renormalization group flow
** 3.2 Short-distance behaviour: the beta-function and asymptotic freedom
** 3.3 The perspective from the theory of condensed matter
*** 3.3.1 Continuous phase transitions: scale-invariance
*** 3.3.2 Critical exponents: the correlation length
*** 3.3.3 Short distances: a natural lower limit
* 4. Nagelian reflections
** 4.1 Nagel endorsed
** 4.2 Renormalizability deduced at low energies as a family of Nagelian reductions
** 4.3 Universality as multiple realizability
