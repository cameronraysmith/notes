**** Definitions
***** the system and environment are represented by sets of discrete-states evolving in continuous time
***** $$\ell$$ states of classical system
***** $$\sigma$$ states of the environment
***** $$p(\ell, \sigma, t)$$ joint probability of finding the system in state $$\ell$$ and the environment in state $$\sigma$$ at time $$t$$
***** $$R^{(\sigma)}_{\ell' \rightarrow \ell}$$ is the rate at which the system transitions from state $$\ell'$$ to state $$\ell$$ when the environment is in state $$\sigma$$
***** $$\mathcal{M}_{\sigma}$$ operator that determines changes of the system relative to the environment in state $$\sigma$$ given by 
****** $$\mathcal{M}_{\sigma} p(\ell, \sigma, t) \equiv \sum_{\ell'} R^{(\sigma)}_{\ell' \rightarrow \ell} p(\ell, \sigma, t)$$
***** $$\lambda A_{\sigma' \rightarrow \sigma}(\ell)$$ is the rate at which the environment transitions from state $$\sigma'$$ to $$\sigma$$
****** Note that in general these rates are considered to be functions that are dependent upon the state of the system $$\ell$$
****** $$\lambda$$ is nothing more than a scaling parameter that allows for the tuning of the rate of environmental switching relative to the rate of switching of the system
***** $$\Pi (\ell, t) = \sum_{\sigma} p(\ell, \sigma, t)$$ the marginal probability over states of the system that results from integrating over states of the environment
***** The transition operators $$R$$ and $$A$$ are chosen so that their diagonal elements are constrained by
****** $$ R^{(\sigma)}_{\ell \rightarrow \ell} = * \sum_{\ell' \neq \ell} R^{(\sigma)}_{\ell \rightarrow \ell'} $$
****** $$ A_{\sigma \rightarrow \sigma}(\ell) = -\sum_{\sigma' \neq \sigma} A_{\sigma \rightarrow \sigma'}(\ell) $$
**** Dynamics
***** $$\frac{d}{dt} p(\ell, \sigma, t) = \mathcal{M}_{\sigma} p(\ell, \sigma, t) + \lambda \sum_{\sigma'} A_{\sigma' \rightarrow \sigma}(\ell) p(\ell, \sigma', t)$$
**** Notes on the regime of interest
***** This paper focuses on the situation where $$\lambda \gg 1$$ which corresponds to a characteristic timescale of environmental dynamics that is much shorter (or, equivalently, that the environmental dynamics are much faster) than that of the system under study
*** B. Simplification in the adiabatic limit
**** The adiabatic limit in this case is associated with that of infinitely fast environmental switching encoded by $$\lambda \rightarrow \infty$$
