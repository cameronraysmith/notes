#+TITLE: The speed of evolution in large asexual populations by Krug et al in 2010
* Outline
** Introduction
** Models
*** Wright-Fisher model
*** Fitness landscapes and selection coefficients
** Infinite population dynamics
*** The evolution equation and its formal solution
*** General asymptotic behavior
*** Case studies
** Finite populations
*** Genetic drift, fixations and clonal interference
*** Model I: single selection coefficient of beneficial mutations
**** The Crow-Kimura-Felsenstein approach
**** The traveling wave approach
**** Comparison to simulations
*** Model II: continuous distribution of selection coefficients
