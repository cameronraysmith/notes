#+TITLE: Quantum field theory for economics and finance by Belal Baaquie in 2018
* Author
** Belal Baaquie was a student of Ken Wilson. As such, his description of renormalization methods may be of particular interest.
** "Any probability distribution which obeys a condition on correlation functions called reflection positivity leads to a local quantum field theory after Wick rotation to Minkowski spacetime. The operation of renormalization is a specified set of mappings from the space of probability distributions to itself. A quantum field theory is called renormalizable if this mapping has a fixed point which gives a quantum field theory."

* 1. Synopsis
** Underlying template
*** application of the concepts of quantum field theory to the description of **indeterminate and random phenomena**, be they **classical** or quantum in origin.
** A general view of applications of tools from physics: quantum mathematics
*** Quantum mathematics refers to the system of mathematical concepts that arise in quantum systems â€“ with some of the leading concepts being that of quantum fields, vacuum expectation values, Hamiltonians, state spaces, operators, correlation func* tions, Feynman path integrals and Lagrangians.1 The interpretation of quantum mathematics, in general, does not have any relation to physics and, instead, needs to reflect the specificity of the domain of inquiry to which quantum mathematics is being applied.

**** 15.14.1 What is a quantum field? Revisited
***** Wilson and Kogut 1974; Wilson 1983
***** A quantum field theory prior to having defined a cutoff must be obtained as the limit of a theory with a cutoff. This is independent of perturbation theory [Wilson and Kogut 1974].
***** A quantum field is understood to consist of infinitely many degrees of freedom organized in a connected sequence of changing length scales. The nonlinear terms in the action couple all the momentum scales. There is no characteristic scale that can be singled out thereby allowing for the neglect of or treatment of the other scales as perturbations [Wislon 1983].
***** Action with cutoff $$\Lambda$$ describes correlation functions at scale $$\Lambda$$. The breaking of scale invariance is essential in defining the renormalized theory.
***** All the divergences of quantum fields are rendered finite by comparing two nearby scales
****** renormalization constants arise from describing correlation functions at scale $$b \Lambda$$ in terms of coupling constants at scale $$\Lambda$$
