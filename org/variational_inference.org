* relationship to the [[file:free_energy_principle.org][free energy principle]]
** "At the core of the background necessary to understand the [[file:free_energy_principle.org][free energy principle]] is the relationship between free energy as it is used in [[file:statistical_physics.org][statistical physics]] versus its use in [[file:probabilistic_inference.org][probabilistic inference]] which is encapsulated in the notion of [[file:variational_inference.org][variational inference]]. The best explanation I know of this relationship is in the formulation of Gibbs free energy via a variational principle in [[file:Information,_physics,_and_computation_by_Marc_Mezard_and_Andrea_Montanari_in_2009.org][Information, physics, and computation by Marc Mezard and Andrea Montanari in 2009]]."
