* contents
** The content is designed to explain how to fit, graph, and understand classical and multilevel linear and generalized linear models and to use these model fits to make predictions and inferences about quantities of interest, including causal treatment effects
** Chapter 1: Why?
*** 1.1 What is multilevel regression modeling?
**** Models for regression coefficients
***** Varying-intercept model
***** Varying-intercept, varying slope model
*** 
** Chapter 2: Concepts and methods from basic probability and statistics
** Part 1A: Fit, understand, and graph classical regressions and generalized linear models. 
*** – Chapter 3: Fit linear regressions and be able to interpret and display estimated coefficients.
*** – Chapter 4: Build linear regression models by transforming and combining variables.
*** – Chapter 5: Fit, understand, and display logistic regression models for binary data.
*** – Chapter 6: Fit, understand, and display generalized linear models, including Poisson regression with overdispersion and ordered logit and probit models.
** Part 1B: Use regression to learn about quantities of substantive interest (not just regression coefficients). 
*** – Chapter 7: Simulate probability models and uncertainty about inferences and predictions.
*** – Chapter 8: Check model fits using fake-data simulation and predictive simu* lation.
*** – Chapter 9: Understand assumptions underlying causal inference. Set up re* gressions for causal inference and understand the challenges that arise.
*** – Chapter 10: Understand the assumptions underlying propensity score match* ing, instrumental variables, and other techniques to perform causal inference when simple regression is not enough. Be able to use these when appropriate.
** Part 2A: Understand and graph multilevel models.
*** – Chapter 11: Understand multilevel data structures and models as generaliza* tions of classical regression.
*** – Chapter 12: Understand and graph simple varying-intercept regressions and interpret as partial-pooling estimates.
*** – Chapter 13: Understand and graph multilevel linear models with varying in* tercepts and slopes, non-nested structures, and other complications.
*** – Chapter 14: Understand and graph multilevel logistic models. 
*** – Chapter 15: Understand and graph multilevel overdispersed Poisson, ordered logit and probit, and other generalized linear models.
** Part 2B: Fit multilevel models using the software packages R and Bugs. 
*** – Chapter 16: Fit varying-intercept regressions and understand the basics of Bugs. Check your programming using fake-data simulation.
*** – Chapter 17: Use Bugs to fit various models from Part 2A. 
*** – Chapter 18: Understand Bayesian inference as a generalization of least squares and maximum likelihood. Use the Gibbs sampler to fit multilevel models.
*** – Chapter 19: Use redundant parameterizations to speed the convergence of the Gibbs sampler.
** Part 3:
*** – Chapter 20: Perform sample size and power calculations for classical and hier* archical models: standard-error formulas for basic calculations and fake-data simulation for harder problems.
*** – Chapter 21: Calculate and understand contrasts, explained variance, partial pooling coefficients, and other summaries of fitted multilevel models.
*** – Chapter 22: Use the ideas of analysis of variance to summarize fitted multilevel models; use multilevel models to perform analysis of variance.
*** – Chapter 23: Use multilevel models in causal inference. 
*** – Chapter 24: Check the fit of models using predictive simulation. 
*** – Chapter 25: Use regression to impute missing data in multivariate datasets.
