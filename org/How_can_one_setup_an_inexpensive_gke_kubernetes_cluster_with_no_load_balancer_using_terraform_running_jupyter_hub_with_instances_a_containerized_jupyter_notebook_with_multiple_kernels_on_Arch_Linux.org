#+TITLE: How can one setup an inexpensive gke kubernetes cluster with no load balancer using terraform running jupyter hub with instances a containerized jupyter notebook with multiple kernels on Arch Linux?
* [[file:setup_an_inexpensive_gke_kubernetes_cluster_with_no_load_balancer_using_terraform.org][setup an inexpensive gke kubernetes cluster with no load balancer using terraform]] running [[file:jupyter_hub.org][jupyter hub]] with instances [[file:a_containerized_jupyter_notebook_with_multiple_kernels_on_Arch_Linux.org][a containerized jupyter notebook with multiple kernels on Arch Linux]]?
* An example of a single instance of jupyter lab is in [[file:a_containerized_jupyter_notebook_with_multiple_kernels_on_Arch_Linux.org][a containerized jupyter notebook with multiple kernels on Arch Linux]]. I would like multiple users to be able to launch this container with scalable underlying computational infrastructure. An example of this is in [[file:probcomp_hosted_jupyter_hub.org][probcomp hosted jupyter hub]]
