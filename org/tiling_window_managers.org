** I have enjoyed using Contexts [[https://contexts.co/]] for switching between applications.
** There are a couple of automatic tiling window managers for MacOS, the most notable being Yabai (https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and Amethyst (https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst).
** Yabai doesn't handle window switching on its own but it can use SKHD (https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) or any other application that can bind terminal commands to keyboard shortcuts such as Hammerspoon ([https://www.hammerspoon.org](https://www.hammerspoon.org/)) or BetterTouchTool ([[https://folivora.ai/)][https://folivora.ai]] or even Keyboard Maestro. The commands are context-aware of spaces and the placement of windows on the x-y plane so you can move between windows relative to their position on the screen.
