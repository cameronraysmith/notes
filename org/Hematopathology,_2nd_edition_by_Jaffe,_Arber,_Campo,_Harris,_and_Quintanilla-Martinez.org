***** Median age is 64 years
***** Slight male predominance 1.2:1
**** Etiology

***** Hypermutated IGHV
***** Transformation pathway
****** 20% of cases show t(14; 18)(q32; q21) BCL2 rearrangement, which is considered a hallmark of follicular lymphoma
****** Such cases may have transformed from a known or occult follicular lymphoma
***** De novo pathway
****** 30% show BCL6 3q27 rearrangement, but is also found in some follicular lymphomas
******* Most commonly the translocation partner involves the immunoglobulin genes via t(3;14)(q27; q32)
****** 73% show BCL6 somatic mutation and is unrelated to the presence or absence of BCL6 rearrangement
******* This is a marker for cells that have been through the germinal center and is thereby also observed in 
***** Myc 8q24 rearrangement occurs in about 10% of DLBCLs being more common in HIV infected patients, pediatric patients, and extranodal lymphomas
****** 40-60% of cases with Myc rearrangment represent double or triple-hit lymphoma with co-existing BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangement and such cases are reclassified as high-grade B-cell lymphoma with BCL2 and/or BCL6 and Myc rearrangement in the 2016 WHO classification
